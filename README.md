# react-alicia
This is my attempt at "following along" and replicating the "ForumAnswer" sample application from Tony Alicia's Pluralsight course 
"React and Flix for Angular Developers".  

I had to change a few things to get it to work with latest version of react and with ES6, but I think 
I was able to do so more or less correctly.  


TODO 
Problem is that the app does not trigger a "re-render" step whenever state is updated.  I can see that state has been updated 
in the console/debugger but react is not reacting to it.  Don't know why. 

Also, I can't figure out how to get the class attributes to show up in the HTML.  Answers do not have border box around them, 
the selected answer is not "green". 

I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what is wrong.
